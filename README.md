# DAMAVAND-OS

A simple hobby operating system written in **C++ and Assembly**, built from scratch without any external dependencies.  
This project is intended for learning about **low-level programming, kernels, and OS development**.

## ðŸ›  Features
- VGA text mode driver (colored text, banners, scrolling)
- Keyboard input handling
- Interrupt handling (IDT + ISR + PIC setup)
- Custom bootloader (written in NASM)
- Minimal kernel written in **C++ (freestanding, no standard library)**

---

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements
To build and run DAMAVAND-OS, youâ€™ll need:

- `g++` (with i386 support, for 32-bit compilation)
- `nasm` (NetWide assembler)
- `ld` (binutils linker)
- `qemu-system-i386` (for running the OS)

On Ubuntu/Debian:
```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install g++ nasm binutils qemu-system-x86
